A macro for Dishonored 2, that allows you to bunnyhop without a freescroll mouse.

If you don't like spacebar you can change the number in `Dish2Macro.cfg` to a different key code. For a list of these key codes look [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd375731(v=vs.85).aspx).

Oh, and don't forget to bind `wheel down` to jump in Dishonored 2.

# Is this allowed in speedruns?

Not yet.

# Why is the sensitivity suddenly so low?

If your mouse has a high polling rate, the mouse hook will, for some reason, slow the ingame sensitivity. I don't know why. Either reduce the mouse polling rate, or bind the macro to a keyboard key instead.
